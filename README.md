__{ R A I S E D }__ is a raised-bed garden planning web application.

![Demo Gif](./raised-gif.gif)

*This is the back-end repo of this project The front-end source code can be found [here](https://github.com/raquii/raised-front-end)*

## General Information

I created this project for FlatIron School's Software Engineering Bootcamp. This project uses a React front-end, with a Ruby back-end using ActiveRecord, Rack, and SQLite for the database.

I built this app because it is something I wanted for myself, to be quite honest. I can't wait to use it to plan my own raised-beds.

To see a demo of the application, [video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/3z6XsOGe6Mw).
